# DSA-Tutorial

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms learning journey** using **C++**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Maintain clean, well-explained solutions
- Learn from my mistakes and improve over time
- Create a future reference for myself and others

## How to use this Repository ?
Each topic is organized into folders (Arrays, Hashing, etc.)

Inside each topic:
  - **Topic README**: High level overview of the particular topics and patterns
  - **Problem Folders**: One problem at a time
      - `solution.cpp` → Clean C++ implementation
      - `README.md` → Approaches, Explanation, Core Concepts, mistakes, insights
        
You can:
- Start from a topic
- Jump directly to a problem
- Read explanations before or after code
---

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Hashing
- Strings
- STL (Vector, Map, Set, etc.)
- Sorting & Searching
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Recursion (upcoming)
- Trees / Graphs (upcoming)

## What Makes This Repo Different

- Explanations written in **my own words**
- Mistakes and wrong attempts are documented
- Focus on **why** an approach works
- Emphasis on revision and long-term learning
- Beginner-friendly, but grows in depth over time

This is **not** a dump of solutions — it’s a learning log.

---
## How to Navigate

- Start with a **topic folder**
- Read the **topic README**
- Pick a problem
- View `solution.cpp`
- Read the problem README for insights

---
## Progress Philosophy

I aim for:
- Depth & Clarity over numbers (1000 questions on LeetCode X)
- Core Understanding over rattafication

This repository will evolve as I do.
